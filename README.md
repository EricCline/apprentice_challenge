## So You Want to be An Apprentice

One of the first things we like to do at DevMynd when we're evaluating
potential apprentices is get them to write some code.  In order to help
with that and for us to evaluate a consistent set of examples, we've
developed this little challenge for you.

## What do I need to do?

* Fork this repository to your own Github account
* Run `bundle install` to install RSpec
* Make the specs pass by writing new code in `/lib` or (if necessary) updating the test
  code
* When you're done send an email to `apprentice@devmynd.com` with a link
  to your forked repository
